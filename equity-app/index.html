            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <img src="img/overview.jpg">
            <div class="content">
                <p>I wanted to help create a size-inclusive shopping experience with my app since I saw an unmet need in my community. Bodies that don’t fit a very narrow body image tend to have a hard time finding clothes that fit their needs.</p>

                <p>My application will give their users more centralized information on retailers and a way to search for places they want to shop at or search for things they want to shop for.</p>
                    
                <p>My target audiences are the people that don’t always feel represented and served by the average brick and mortar store. This would include people that shop for short, tall, curvy, 00, XXS-XS, XXL+, and sizes 12 and up. My target age group is late teens to early thirties because that’s when people develop and furnish their closet.</p>

                <p>My application addresses an equity issue because everybody deserves to be able to buy
                    clothes that they like and that fit them. Right now there are groups of people who
                    struggle with that because the fashion industry is rarely catered to all human bodies so
                    my application will make it easier to find shops that cater to my audience. A 2021 study that included 5,500 women found that their average size is between 16 and 18 whilst most stores only carry sizes up to 12. I want to create a total of 17 filters for sizes and tags like price range and organization to improve shopping experience and outcome.</p>

                <h3>Interviews</h3>
                <p>Can you tell me about a negative shopping experience you've had before?</p>

                <p> As a child I went to Justice with my mom to buy leggings and when my mom. She asked a store associate if they had leggings and told her that I'm a little big. The store associate was sure they'd find something for us but when she saw me, all she said was, "Oh...." - PersonA</p>

                <p>When stores are disorganized and clothes are mislabeled it's very frustrating for me. - PersonB</p>

                <p>Jeans and slacks are too long and it's rare to find any that are catered to my height. Finding business attire is also extra difficult because most of them are too long and big. The only options I've found so far are out of my price range. - PersonC</p>

                <p>Do you feel part of the target demographic of the average mall store? Why or why not?</p>

                <p>No, because stores like Forever 21 and H&M don't have the styles I want in my size or at affordable prices. Their clearance rack tends to be disasters where sizes are impossible to find. - PersonA</p>

                <p>Size-wise, yes. But not always my aesthetic and sustainable fashion is not reasonably priced. - PersonB</p>

                <p>No. I feel like my body type gets catered to less than average. Even in high school, I still had to shop in the kids section. The styles I wanted were not available in the kids' section where the clothes fit me better. - PersonC</p>

                <h3>My Take-Away:</h3>
                <p>After these interviews, I saw how it would make sense to include additional tags that allowed for more filtering. Price range and overarching clothes style, like casual or business, would be helpful because those factors are also important when a user would decide what store can cater to their needs.

                <p>This project made the process of creating with intentions clearer to me. In hindsight, my previous attempts at creating applications seem very superficial. After this project, I learned the importance of early UX research and how to conduct more productive usability testing. I'm most proud of how I incorporated my usability testing feedback into my final designs. I found the UX research stages still very challenging. I struggled with figuring out which methods would best work for my goals and work with my limitations.</p>
